Computation of an extractive distillation column with affine arithmetic

Abstract

The need of reliably solving non-linear systems of equations often arises in 
the everyday practice of chemical engineering. In general, standard methods 
cannot provide theoretical guarantee for convergence to a solution, cannot 
reliably find multiple solutions, and cannot prove non-existence of solutions. 
Interval methods provide tools to overcome these problems, thus achieving 
reliability. To the authors' best knowledge, computation of distillation 
columns with interval methods have not yet been considered in the literature.

This paper presents significant enhancements compared to a previously published 
interval method of the authors. The proposed branch-and-prune algorithm is 
guaranteed to converge, and is fairly general at the same time. If no solution 
exists than this information is provided by the method as a result. Power of 
the suggested method is demonstrated by solving, with guaranteed convergence, 
even the MESH equations of a 22 stage extractive distillation column with a 
ternary mixture.
